## Model-Driven Approach
Application is developed by modeling its components, no coding required

## User Roles & Responsibilities
Case Participants:
- Case Workers _work on cases_
- Case Managers _monitor status, goals, deadlines, create reports_

Case Designers:
- Business Architects _define objectives & requirements, specify application behavior_
- System Architects: _complete the application, configure UI, decisions, correspondence, review_

## Run Time vs. Design Time User Portals
Run time portal: for case participants
- Case Worker Portal 
- Case Manager Portal

Design time portal: for case designers
- Pega Express
- Designer Studio

### Pega Express vs. Designer Studio
__Pega Express__: _Drafting_  
Easy way to model Case structure and process steps, basic functionality  
(similar to Signavio Quickmodel)
- create cases, fields, user views
- manage users
- define settings
- simulate application
1) high level structure (life cycle), stages, processes, steps
2) forms for assignment and approval steps -> fields to collect/present information -> data model

__Designer Studio__: _Refinement_  
Advanced features 
Case life cycles
- _work area_: edit requirements, case types, user views, data models, reports
- _header_: tool menu, create cases, search for records, launch new portals
- _explorer area_: navigate to specific records/cases/data
- _developer toolbar_: debug, performance check, UI analysis

### Case Worker vs. Case Manager portal
__Case Worker portal__:  
Case workers can work on assigned cases

__Case Manager portal__:  
Manage assigned cases, view status of cases and reports
